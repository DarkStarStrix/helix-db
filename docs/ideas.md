**Where**

- a Where clause will be used to filter the results of a query.  
- the methods in the scope of a where clause will need to evaluate to a boolean value. 

**Has**

- the has clause will evaluate to a boolean
- the has clause will take an anonymous traversal that evaluates to a boolean

**Range**
- Will return the first N records

**Range** 
- Will flatten everything in the current step and will return the count
